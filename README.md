# java-core

1. Download a development environment such as "Eclipse" or "Netbeans".

2. Create a new class selecting new/class.

3. A class remodels a real world projects or code into code.

4. Start writing the code importing Java libraries

##java default libraries.

*import java util.Scanner;
*import java.util.*;

### creating a class,declarating methods.

public class "classname"{

* methods declaration

private "datatype(float,int etc)" "method name";

* methods are always private, except the main method.

* Once methods are declarated, you must generate constructors

* right click/source/generate constructor using fields

* The contstructor is now generated.

public "classname"{

* Now you can carry out different tasks, for example printing on the screen a sum of numbers.

}

* Now you need to create a main method, where the code will be executed.

 public static void main(String[] args){

* "static" means that this method is shared with every object with the name of this class.
* Create now a new object.

"classname" "newname" = new "classname"();

}

}
